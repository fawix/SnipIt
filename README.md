# SnipIt
SnipIt is a very simple screenshot application for GNOME3 environment.

It's meant to be simple and fast to use.


How to use:

1. navigate to the src folder
2. run "sudo python setup.py install"
2. launch the application
3. click and drag the mouse around the area you want to take a screenshot from
4. paste somewhere ...
5.  ...or/and save to file

Possible ways to launch the app on GNOME3:

Ways to Launch:

1. Command-line:
    - open terminal 	
    - type snipit
2. GNOME quick command line shortcut (my favorite):
    - ALT+F2	
    - type snipit

**NOTE:** Still trying to figure out how to add GUI shortcut via setup.py
