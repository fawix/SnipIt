# SnipIt
SnipIt is a very simple screenshot application for GNOME3 environment.

It's meant to be simple and fast to use.


How to use:

2. launch the application through snipit.py
3. click and drag the mouse around the area you want to take a screenshot from
4. paste somewhere ...
5  ...or/and save to file

Feel free to contribute!

**NOTE:** Still trying to figure out how to create a setup.py
